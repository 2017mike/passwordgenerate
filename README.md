# passwordgenerate
Password generate generates a password of as many character lengths as you'd like and includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers. 
The way this project works is that it contains a string of all possible uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and (most) special characters. It then randomly chooses a mixture to put into a password and displays it on the screen. 
This project taught me how to put strings together and index information from them. I also learned how to display information from JavaScript into the webpage.
